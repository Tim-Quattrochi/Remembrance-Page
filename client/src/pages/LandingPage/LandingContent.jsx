                  Jerry was born on March 9th, 1990 and unfortunately passed
                  away in March 2021. He had non-verbal autism and was a
                  huge fan of 80's music, particularly Madonna and Journey.
                  Purpose of this website In honor of Jerry's memory, I have
                  created this website as a way for friends and family to
                  come together and share their memories of Jerry.
              </p>
              <p className="personalPara">
                  Visitors can post on Jerry's guest book and view photos of
                  him. Keeping Jerry's Memory Alive This website is a way
                  for us to keep Jerry's memory alive and to remember the
                  joy and love he brought into our lives. I hope that this
                  website will be a source of comfort and support for those
                  who knew and loved Jerry.
